# Terms-ToDo
Terms-ToDo is a terminal-based to-do list written in nodejs and distributed using npm. The focus is to have a simple CLI that can store, show, and manage your to-do tasks without the need for a GUI.

## Usage

## Future Plans
I would like to migrate from the 'arg' package to the 'args' package (Confusing, right?) for managing command-line options and commands. 'arg' is too strict and doesn't allow for auto-documentation, whereas 'args' allows for better command-line interpretation and auto-documentation.
